# Specification, Standards and Formats / Open Document Format (ODF)

TODO

> The OpenDocument Format (ODF) is an open XML-based document file format for office applications
  to be used for documents containing text, spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements.
  The file format makes transformations to other formats simple by leveraging and reusing
  existing standards wherever possible.
> As an open standard under the stewardship of OASIS, OpenDocument also creates the possibility
  for new types of applications and solutions to be developed other than traditional
  office productivity applications.
