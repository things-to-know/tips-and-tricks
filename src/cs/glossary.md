### Algorithm \[Computer science\]

TODO

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm

> In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of mathematically rigorous
  instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.

### Algorithms suite \[Cryptography\]

A set of one or more [cryptographic algorithms](#cryptographic-algorithm), often used together
to provide a security service, such as digital signatures.

### Associative array \[Computer science\]

Aka "dictionary", [map](#map-noun-computer-science).

An _abstract_ [data type](#data-type-computer-science) that [maps](#map-verb-computer-science)
_keys_ to values.

### Cipher \[Cryptography\]

TODO

See [Encryption](#encryption-cryptography), [Decryption](#decryption-cryptography),
[Encryption algorithm](#encryption-algorithm-cryptography).

### Ciphertext \[Cryptography\]

Aka "encrypted information", "encoded information" (but technically different from).

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext):

> [...] the result of [encryption](#encryption-cryptography) performed on
  [plaintext](#plaintext-cryptography) using an [algorithm](#cryptographic-algorithm),
  called a [cipher](#cipher-cryptography).

It is:

> [...] also known as encrypted or encoded information because it contains a form of the
  original [plaintext](#plaintext-cryptography) that is unreadable by a human or computer
  without the proper [cipher](#cipher-cryptography) to [decrypt](#decryption-cryptography) it.

Warning: don't confuse with _codetext_, which is the result of a _code_, not a
[cipher](#cipher-cryptography).

See [Encryption](#encryption-cryptography), [Decryption](#decryption-cryptography),
[Encryption algorithm](#encryption-algorithm-cryptography).

### Code \[Computer science\]

In computer science, a _code_ is \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code)\]:

> [...] an [algorithm](#algorithm-computer-science) that uniquely represents _symbols_ from some
  _source alphabet_, by _encoded strings_, which may be in some other _target alphabet_.
> An extension of the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source alphabet
  is obtained by concatenating the encoded strings.

### Code symbol \[Computer science\]

TODO

### Computation \[Computer science\]

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation):

> A computation is any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetic calculation that is "well-defined".
> Common examples of computation are _mathematical equation solving_ and the execution of
  [computer algorithms](#algorithm-computer-science).

_Computer science_ is an academic field that involves the study of _computation_.

### Computer system

TODO

### Cryptographic algorithm

TODO

### Cryptographic application

TODO

### Cryptographic hash

TODO

### Cryptographic hash function (CHF)

Wikipedia:

> [...] a [hash algorithm](#hash-algorithm) that has special properties desirable for a
  [cryptographic application](#cryptographic-application):
>
> - the probability of a particular n-bit output result ([hash value](#hash-value)) for a
>   random input string ("message") is 2^{-n} (as for any good hash), so the hash value
>   can be used as a representative of the message;
> - finding an input string that matches a given hash value (a pre-image) is _infeasible_,
>   _assuming all input strings are equally likely_.
>   The _resistance_ to such search is quantified as _security strength_: a
>   [cryptographic hash](#cryptographic-hash) with `n` bits of hash value is expected to have a preimage resistance strength of
n
{\displaystyle n} bits, unless the space of possible input values is significantly smaller than
2
n
{\displaystyle 2^{n}} (a practical example can be found in ยง Attacks on hashed passwords);
a second preimage resistance strength, with the same expectations, refers to a similar problem of finding a second message that matches the given hash value when one message is already known;
finding any pair of different messages that yield the same hash value (a collision) is also infeasible: a cryptographic hash is expected to have a collision resistance strength of
n
/
2
{\displaystyle n/2} bits (lower due to the birthday paradox).

### Cryptography

The discipline that embodies principles, means and methods for the
[transformation of data](#data-transformation-computer-science) to:

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption):

> [...] the process of transforming information in a way that, ideally, only authorized parties
  can ~~decode~~ \[decrypt\].
> This process converts the original representation of the information, known as
  [plaintext](#plaintext-cryptography), into an alternative form known as
  [ciphertext](#ciphertext-cryptography).

### Encryption algorithm \[Cryptography\]

Digital signatures are a type of [public-key cryptography](#public-key-cryptography), and are
commonly used for _software distribution_, financial transactions, legal contracts,
and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or [tampering](#data-tampering-computer-science).

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature):

> A mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents.
  A valid digital signature on a message gives a recipient confidence that the message
  came from a sender known to the recipient.
> [...] a digital signature on a message is mathematically bound to the content of the message
  so that it is infeasible for anyone to forge a valid digital signature on any other message.

### Digital signature scheme

A digital signature scheme typically consists of three algorithms:

- A [key generation algorithm](#key-generation-algorithm-cryptography)
- A [signing algorithm](#signing-algorithm-digital-signature)

> A hash table uses a [hash function](#hash-function) to _compute_ an _index_, also called a
  [hash code](#hash-code), into an array of _buckets_ or _slots_, from which the desired value
  can be found. During _lookup_, the _key_ is [hashed](#hash-verb-computer-science),

  in a file, which, when processed through a [cryptographic algorithm](#cryptographic-algorithm),
  can encode or decode cryptographic data.
> Based on the used method, the key can be different sizes and varieties, but in all cases,
  the strength of the encryption relies on the security of the key being maintained.
  A key's security strength is dependent on its algorithm, the size of the key,
  the [generation of the key](#key-generation-algorithm-cryptography), and the process of key exchange.

### Key generation algorithm \[Cryptography\]

> [...] which describes how an output of a _mathematical function_ is
  [computed](#computation-computer-science) given an input.
  [...] it describes how _units of computations_, _memories_ and _communications_ are organized.
>
> The _computational complexity_ of an [algorithm](#algorithm-computer-science) can be measured
  given a model of computation. Using a model allows studying the performance of algorithms
  independently of the _variations_ that are specific to particular _implementations_ and
  specific technology.

Categories of models of computation:

- _Sequential models_ (or _state models_):
  e.g. _Finite-state machine_, _Turing machine_, _Random-access machine_
